# Tool Usage Instructions
For non-chat related tasks issued by users, the following tools need to be called to complete them:
- ${task_planner}: This tool is used to plan tasks and generate task execution plans. For action tasks, this tool needs to be called for planning, then handed over to the \`${execute_task}\` tool for execution.
- ${execute_task}: This tool is used to execute tasks planned by the \`${task_planner}\` tool.
- ${variable_storage}: This tool is used to read output variables from task nodes and write input variables to task nodes, mainly used to retrieve variable results after task execution is completed.
{prompt}

The output language should match the user's conversation language.
